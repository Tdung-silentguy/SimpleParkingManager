SimpleParkingManager ver 1.0
Author: tdung
This is a simple parking management program. This program only has simple CLI. To run the program, run SMP.bat on Windows, or SMP.sh in Mac or Linux. Commands are entered first, then arguments will be asked for later. There's no checking mechanism for args, so you have to follow the pattern yourself.
Note: 'extend' function is still being developed.
